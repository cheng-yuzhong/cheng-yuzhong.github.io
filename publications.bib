Different from previous studies under lowfrequency sampling, high-frequency of data leads to a very simple form of the asymptotic covariance matrix. Through easy-to-compute preliminary contrast functions, a practical two-stage manner without numerical optimization is formulated to conduct not only an asymptotically eﬃcient estimation of the drift parameters but also a high-precision estimator of the diffusion parameter.

	abstract = {Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is strongly associated with aging. Telomeres are DNA sequences that protect chromosomes from damage and shorten with age. Telomere-related genes (TRGs) may play a role in AD's pathogenesis.
Objectives
To identify TRGs related to aging clusters in AD patients, explore their immunological characteristics, and build a TRG-based prediction model for AD and AD subtypes.
Methods
We analyzed the gene expression profiles of 97 AD samples from the GSE132903 dataset, using aging-related genes (ARGs) as clustering variables. We also assessed immune-cell infiltration in each cluster. We performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify cluster-specific differentially expressed TRGs. We compared four machine-learning models (random forest, generalized linear model [GLM], gradient boosting model, and support vector machine) for predicting AD and AD subtypes based on TRGs and validated TRGs by conducting an artificial neural network (ANN) analysis and a nomogram model.
Results
We identified two aging clusters in AD patients with distinct immunological features: Cluster A had higher immune scores than Cluster B. Cluster A and the immune system are intimately associated, and this association could affect immunological function and result in AD via the digestive system. The GLM predicted AD and AD subtypes most accurately and was validated by the ANN analysis and nomogram model.
Conclusion
Our analyses revealed novel TRGs associated with aging clusters in AD patients and their immunological characteristics. We also developed a promising prediction model based on TRGs for assessing AD risk.},

Previous research highlighted the potential of LSTM networks in estimating parameters of a-stable Levy driven SDEs, but faced limitations including high time complexity and constraints of the LSTM's chaining property. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the PEnet, a novel CNN-LSTM based three-stage model that offers (a) an end-to-end approach with superior accuracy and adaptability to varying data structures, (b) enhanced inference speed for long-sequence observations through initial data feature condensation by CNN, and (c) high generalization capability, allowing its application to various complex SDE scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets confirm PEnet's significant advantage in estimating SDE parameters associated with noise characteristics, establishing it as a competitive method for SDE parameter estimation in the presence of Levy noise.},

	abstract = {To address the challenges in estimating parameters of the widely applied Student-Lévy process, the study introduces two distinct methods: a likelihood-based approach and a data-driven approach. A two-step quasi-likelihood-based method is initially proposed, countering the non-closed nature of the Student-Lévy process's distribution function under convolution. This method utilizes the limiting properties observed in high-frequency data, offering estimations via a quasi-likelihood function characterized by asymptotic normality. Additionally, a novel neural-network-based parameter estimation technique is advanced, independent of high-frequency observation assumptions. Utilizing a CNN-LSTM framework, this method effectively processes sparse, local jump-related data, extracts deep features, and maps these to the parameter space using a fully connected neural network. This innovative approach ensures minimal assumption reliance, end-to-end processing, and high scalability, marking a significant advancement in parameter estimation techniques. The efficacy of both methods is substantiated through comprehensive numerical experiments, demonstrating their robust performance in diverse scenarios.},

	abstract = {This paper considers estimating the parameters in a regime-switching stochastic differential equation(SDE) driven by Normal Inverse Gaussian(NIG) noise. The model under consideration incorporates a continuous-time finite state Markov chain to capture regime changes, enabling a more realistic representation of evolving market conditions or environmental factors. Although the continuous dynamics are typically observable, the hidden nature of the Markov chain introduces significant complexity, rendering standard likelihood-based methods less effective. To address these challenges, we propose an estimation algorithm designed for discrete, high-frequency observations, even when the Markov chain is not directly observed. Our approach integrates the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which iteratively refines parameter estimates in the presence of latent variables, with a quasi-likelihood method adapted to NIG noise. Notably, this method can simultaneously estimate parameters within both the SDE coefficients and the driving noise. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed method provides reasonable estimation under challenging conditions.},

We propose the Multi-level Parameter Estimation Network (MLPEnet), a three-stage model incorporating a parameter heterogeneity condensation phase to improve inference speed and generalization.
