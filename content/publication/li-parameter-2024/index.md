abstract: "To address the challenges in estimating parameters of the widely applied
  Student-Lévy process, the study introduces two distinct methods: a likelihood-based
  approach and a data-driven approach. A two-step quasi-likelihood-based method is
  initially proposed, countering the non-closed nature of the Student-Lévy process's
  distribution function under convolution. This method utilizes the limiting properties
  observed in high-frequency data, offering estimations via a quasi-likelihood function
  characterized by asymptotic normality. Additionally, a novel neural-network-based
  parameter estimation technique is advanced, independent of high-frequency observation
  assumptions. Utilizing a CNN-LSTM framework, this method effectively processes sparse,
  local jump-related data, extracts deep features, and maps these to the parameter
  space using a fully connected neural network. This innovative approach ensures minimal
  assumption reliance, end-to-end processing, and high scalability, marking a significant
  advancement in parameter estimation techniques. The efficacy of both methods is
  substantiated through comprehensive numerical experiments, demonstrating their robust
  performance in diverse scenarios."
