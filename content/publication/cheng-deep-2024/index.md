abstract: Accurate weather forecasting is of paramount importance for a wide range
  of practical applications, drawing substantial scientific and societal interest.
  However, the intricacies of weather systems pose substantial challenges to accurate
  predictions. This research introduces a multilayer perceptron model tailored for
  weather forecasting in Itoshima, Kyushu, Japan. Our meticulously designed architecture
  demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, surpassing benchmarks
  such as Long Short-Term Memory and Recurrent Neural Networks.
