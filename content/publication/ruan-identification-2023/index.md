abstract: "Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that
  is strongly associated with aging. Telomeres are DNA sequences that protect chromosomes
  from damage and shorten with age. Telomere-related genes (TRGs) may play a role
  in AD's pathogenesis. Objectives To identify TRGs related to aging clusters in AD
  patients, explore their immunological characteristics, and build a TRG-based prediction
  model for AD and AD subtypes. Methods We analyzed the gene expression profiles of
  97 AD samples from the GSE132903 dataset, using aging-related genes (ARGs) as clustering
  variables. We also assessed immune-cell infiltration in each cluster. We performed
  a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify cluster-specific differentially
  expressed TRGs. We compared four machine-learning models (random forest, generalized
  linear model [GLM], gradient boosting model, and support vector machine) for predicting
  AD and AD subtypes based on TRGs and validated TRGs by conducting an artificial
  neural network (ANN) analysis and a nomogram model. Results We identified two aging
  clusters in AD patients with distinct immunological features: Cluster A had higher
  immune scores than Cluster B. Cluster A and the immune system are intimately associated,
  and this association could affect immunological function and result in AD via the
  digestive system. The GLM predicted AD and AD subtypes most accurately and was validated
  by the ANN analysis and nomogram model. Conclusion Our analyses revealed novel TRGs
  associated with aging clusters in AD patients and their immunological characteristics.
  We also developed a promising prediction model based on TRGs for assessing AD risk."
