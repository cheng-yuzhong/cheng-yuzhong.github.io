abstract: This study addresses the challenges in parameter estimation of stochastic
  differential equations (SDEs) driven by non-Gaussian noises, which are critical
  in understanding dynamic phenomena such as price fluctuations and the spread of
  infectious diseases. Previous research highlighted the potential of LSTM networks
  in estimating parameters of a-stable Levy driven SDEs, but faced limitations including
  high time complexity and constraints of the LSTM's chaining property. To mitigate
  these issues, we introduce the PEnet, a novel CNN-LSTM based three-stage model that
  offers (a) an end-to-end approach with superior accuracy and adaptability to varying
  data structures, (b) enhanced inference speed for long-sequence observations through
  initial data feature condensation by CNN, and (c) high generalization capability,
  allowing its application to various complex SDE scenarios. Experiments on synthetic
  datasets confirm PEnet's significant advantage in estimating SDE parameters associated
  with noise characteristics, establishing it as a competitive method for SDE parameter
  estimation in the presence of Levy noise.
