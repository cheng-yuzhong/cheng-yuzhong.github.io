abstract: This study tackles key challenges in parameter estimation for stochastic
  differential equations (SDEs) driven by non-Gaussian noise, which are crucial for
  modeling dynamic phenomena like price fluctuations and epidemic spread. Traditional
  quasi-likelihood methods struggle in complex SDE scenarios due to strong assumptions
  and step-size constraints. Recent data-driven approaches using neural networks have
  shown promise but face issues like performance degradation on long sequences and
  limited generalization at domain boundaries. We propose the Multi-level Parameter
  Estimation Network (MLPEnet), a three-stage model incorporating a parameter heterogeneity
  condensation phase to improve inference speed and generalization. Experimental results
  on synthetic datasets indicate that MLPEnet provides better overall accuracy compared
  to previous methods and effectively reduces performance decline at the boundaries
  of the training domain, highlighting its potential for broad applicability.
