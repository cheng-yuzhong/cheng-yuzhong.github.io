 abstract = {Gaussian quasi-likelihood estimation of the parameter in the square-root diffusion process is studied under high-frequency sampling. Different from previous studies under lowfrequency sampling, high-frequency of data leads to a very simple form of the asymptotic covariance matrix. Through easy-to-compute preliminary contrast functions, a practical two-stage manner without numerical optimization is formulated to conduct not only an asymptotically eﬃcient estimation of the drift parameters but also a high-precision estimator of the diffusion parameter. Simulation experiments are given to illustrate the results. © 2022 EcoSta Econometrics and Statistics. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
