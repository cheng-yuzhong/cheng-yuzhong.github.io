abstract: Gaussian quasi-likelihood estimation of the parameter in the square-root
  diffusion process is studied under high-frequency sampling. Different from previous
  studies under lowfrequency sampling, high-frequency of data leads to a very simple
  form of the asymptotic covariance matrix. Through easy-to-compute preliminary contrast
  functions, a practical two-stage manner without numerical optimization is formulated
  to conduct not only an asymptotically eﬃcient estimation of the drift parameters
  but also a high-precision estimator of the diffusion parameter. Simulation experiments
  are given to illustrate the results. © 2022 EcoSta Econometrics and Statistics.
