 abstract = {This study explores a Gaussian quasi-likelihood approach for estimating parameters of diffusion processes with Markovian regime switching. Assuming the ergodicity under high-frequency sampling, we will show the asymptotic normality of the unknown parameters contained in the drift and diffusion coefficients and present a consistent explicit estimator for the generator of the Markov chain. Simulation experiments are conducted to illustrate the theoretical results obtained.},
