abstract: This study explores a Gaussian quasi-likelihood approach for estimating
  parameters of diffusion processes with Markovian regime switching. Assuming the
  ergodicity under high-frequency sampling, we will show the asymptotic normality
  of the unknown parameters contained in the drift and diffusion coefficients and
  present a consistent explicit estimator for the generator of the Markov chain. Simulation
  experiments are conducted to illustrate the theoretical results obtained.
