        My work sits at the intersection of **probability theory**, **statistics**, and **deep learning**.  
        At the moment, I focus on **statistical inference for stochastic differential equations (SDEs)**.
  
        **Current interests**
  
        - **Statistical inference for SDEs** – efficient parameter estimation, high-frequency sampling, asymptotic theory  
        - **Deep-learning–based calibration of stochastic models** – network for SDEs
        - **Fluctuations of interacting particle systems** – limit theorems, large-deviations
